## 1- Purposes of Personal Data Processing and Legal Basis

-   Purposes related to the provision of requested services.
    

-   Firstly, the processing of the required personal data aims to properly and completely establish and execute ongoing contractual relationships with you, and more specifically to effectively manage the contractual relationship and to fulfill the legal and contractual obligations arising from it.
    

-   Purposes of compliance with obligations under the law, regulations, or EU legislation.

### Legal Basis

The processing of personal data for the purposes set out in points 1.1 and 1.2 above is necessary, pursuant to Article 24 of the Code and Article 6 of the EU Regulation, to fulfill an obligation required by law, regulation, or European Union legislation, or because the processing is necessary to fulfill obligations arising from a contract to which the data subject is a party, or to meet specific requests of the data subject before the conclusion of the contract, or finally, because the data processing pursues administrative-accounting purposes under Article 34 i-ter of the Code. The processing of personal data for the purposes referred to in point 13 above is based on a legitimate interest of the Data Controller to strengthen commercial ties with the data subject, while always reserving the right of the data subject to object to the processing at any time, easily and free of charge.

Any failure to provide the data referred to in points 1.1 and 1.2 above, in whole or in part, could result in the Data Controller’s inability to execute the contract or to properly fulfill all obligations, such as those of a remunerative, tax, and insurance nature, related to the contractual relationship.

## b- Data Retention Period and Other Information

In compliance with the principles of lawfulness, purpose limitation, and data minimization, pursuant to Article 5 of EU Regulation No. 2016/679, personal data will be stored for the period necessary to achieve the purposes for which they are collected and processed according to the criteria specified below pursuant to Article 13, paragraph 2, letter (a) of the EU Regulation:
